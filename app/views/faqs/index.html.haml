        I see a value for $ Saved and GHG Reduced. What does this mean?
    .accordion-body.collapse{id: "#{cid}"}
      .accordion-inner 
        %li $ Saved is calculated based on a vehicle’s fuel consumption at a cost of $1.17 per litre. During the 3 week Challenge period, reduced gas consumption compared to the initial 3 week baseline is reflected here.
        %li GHG Reduced is the green house gas emissions reduced as a result travelling less distance. For the calculation, the following assumptions have been made:
        %ul
          %li The vehicle driven is a mid-sized car. Those driving a compact, hybrid or electric vehicle  may have lower GHG reductions and those driving a larger truck or SUV may have higher GHG reductions
          %li GHGs = carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) where 0.002352 kg of CO2e are saved for each  1km reduced
        %li The GHG calculation is based on Nova Scotia Environment’s Carbon Calculator developed by CSA Standards [link “Carbon Calculator” to http://www.climatechange.gov.ns.ca/ghgcalculators/documents/Carbon%20Footprint%20Calculators%20Guidance%20Document.pdf ]

        Do I need to achieve a 10% reduction every day to qualify for the Challenge rewards? 
    .accordion-body.collapse{id: "#{cid}"}
      .accordion-inner 
        No. You only need a total reduction of 10% over your 3 week baseline. You can achieve this by making small reductions each day of the Challenge, or make large reductions on specific days. As long as you reduce both your driving distance and gas consumption by 10% overall during the challenge period, you will qualify.

        Do I need to achieve a 10% reduction in both kilometers (km) travelled and gas consumed to qualify for my rewards?
    .accordion-body.collapse{id: "#{cid}"}
      .accordion-inner 
        Yes. Compared to your total 3 week Baseline, your total 3 week Challenge must be 10% less in both kilometers travelled and gas consumed.  Please note: If you reduce your kilometers travelled and gas consumed by 5%, you qualify for a $10 gas card

        Where does the money for the rewards come from?
    .accordion-body.collapse{id: "#{cid}"}
      .accordion-inner 
        Funding for Shuttle, including for the gas cards and the final draw of $2,500, is provided by Toronto Atmospheric Fund, Ontario Centre for Excellence and the Auto Recyclers of Canada.
        %p As part of the Canadian Vehicle Use Study, Transport Canada provides draw incentives to reward participation and the return of their data loggers at the end of the Study period. The draws for $1,000 and $1,500 are provided courtesy of Transport Canada
